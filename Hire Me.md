# Let's Connect!

I am available for hire, full or part time on a C2C, 1099, or W2 basis. Whether you need project support for a few months or are looking to fill a permanent position, give me a call and let's see if there's a fit.

I am the translator or liason between business and technology. Bridging the gap is my specialty through user-centric methodologies like ADKAR or the Microsoft Service Adoption Framework.

My background and degree are in business, but I have been working with the Microsoft 365 platform for 7 years. My experience in compliance frameworks like ISO 9001 give me a unique perspective on how businesses work and how to apply the Microsoft platform to achieve desired business outcomes.

Ideal job titles include:
- Microsoft 365 Consultant or Specialist
- Change Management Consultant or Specialist
- Microsoft Teams Administrator
- Microsoft Power Platform Consultant
